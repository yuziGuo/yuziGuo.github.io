I recently wrote an [answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/22298352/answer/3595067328) on Zhihu (a Chinese version of Quora) , explaining the [physical meaning of convolution](https://www.zhihu.com/question/22298352/answer/3595067328) via an example of continuously tapping a stick and another example involving multiplication (yes, I applied what I just learned from understanding FFT). My understanding of these topics might be quite shallow, but I hope to deepen my understanding as I continue to share.
