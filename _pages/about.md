I am an incoming fourth-year Ph.D student in Gaoling School of AI, Renmin University of China ([GASI@RUC](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm)), advised by [Prof. Zhewei Wei](https://www.weizhewei.com). I previously earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from RUC. My master journey was primarily about graph databases and word embeddings, advised by Professors [Xiaoyong Du](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/47/3542.html) and [Wei Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v04EazgAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Since the beginning of my Ph.D. journey, 
my primary research has focused on **Graph Neural Networks**(GNNs),
particularly  **Spectral GNNs**. In addition, I am interested in other aspects of graph learning, such as Equivariant and Invariant GNNs (IGNs), rewiring methods, and expressive GNNs.  

Also, I have been deepening my understanding of the theoretical foundations of GNNs, including signal processing and numerical algebra. 

<!-- - Ph.D. level: Polynomial-based Graph Neural Networks. 

Good reader level: Equivariant and Invariant GNNs (IGNs); Rewiring methods; Expressive GNNs.   

Continuous learner level: Signal processing & Dictionary learning; Numerical algebra; Graph Algorithms. 

Future Topics of Interest: Stability of (Spectral) GNNs; Simulation with GNNs; Learning for algebra. -->
