<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an incoming fourth-year Ph.D student in Gaoling School of AI, Renmin University of China ([GASI@RUC](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm)), advised by [Prof. Zhewei Wei](www.weizhewei.com). I previously earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from RUC. My master journey was primarily about graph databases and word embeddings, advised by Professors [Xiaoyong Du](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/47/3542.htmlhttps://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/47/3542.html) and [Wei Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v04EazgAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Since the beginning of my Ph.D. journey, 
my primary research has focused on **Graph Neural Networks**(GNNs),
particularly  **Spectral GNNs**. In addition, I am interested in other aspects of graph learning, such as Equivariant and Invariant GNNs (IGNs), rewiring methods, and expressive GNNs.  

Also, I have been deepening my understanding of the theoretical foundations of GNNs, including signal processing and numerical algebra. 

<!-- - Ph.D. level: Polynomial-based Graph Neural Networks. 

Good reader level: Equivariant and Invariant GNNs (IGNs); Rewiring methods; Expressive GNNs.   

Continuous learner level: Signal processing & Dictionary learning; Numerical algebra; Graph Algorithms. 

Future Topics of Interest: Stability of (Spectral) GNNs; Simulation with GNNs; Learning for algebra. -->
